1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4	Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for 
each activity and each subject (tidy_dataset.txt)
